### **1. Mobile Network Performance Optimization**

**Goal:** Analyze and improve the Quality of Service (QoS) in 4G/5G networks.
**Key tasks:**

* Use drive-test tools (e.g., TEMS Investigation, Nemo Outdoor) to collect real-world signal data.
* Measure KPIs: latency, throughput, signal strength (RSRP/RSRQ), call drop rate.
* Propose and simulate optimizations (cell parameter tuning, antenna tilt, spectrum allocation).
  **Deliverable:** Dashboard + optimization plan.

### **2. AI-based Network Fault Prediction**

**Goal:** Use machine learning to predict and prevent network failures.
**Key tasks:**

* Collect logs from base stations and core network elements.
* Train models to detect anomaly patterns before failures.
* Automate alerts and possible corrective actions.
  **Deliverable:** AI model + real-time monitoring dashboard.

### **3. mixing 1 and 2 + using qgis and gps**
