"Performance Optimization of Mobile Networks in Algeria: Case Study of [Djezzy/Mobilis]"


---

1. Context & Problem Statement

Mobile operators like Djezzy and Mobilis face growing challenges due to:

Increasing user demand for high-speed internet and reliable voice services.

Network congestion during peak hours.

Coverage gaps in rural or dense urban areas.

Need to transition toward 5G-readiness while maintaining current 4G quality.


Even with advanced infrastructure, QoS (Quality of Service) and QoE (Quality of Experience) vary depending on location, time, and technology (2G/3G/4G).


---

2. Project Objectives

1. Analyze current mobile network performance (coverage, throughput, latency, call drop rates).


2. Identify bottlenecks causing performance degradation.


3. Propose and simulate optimization strategies (parameter tuning, load balancing, antenna tilting, frequency refarming, etc.).


4. Evaluate QoS improvement using KPIs before and after optimization.




---

3. Methodology

Phase 1: Data Collection

Field measurements with drive test tools (Tems Investigation, Nemo, Genex Probe).

KPIs from operator's OSS (Operations Support System).

Coverage maps & network topology data.


Phase 2: Analysis

Identify worst-performing cells/sectors.

Use GIS mapping to visualize problem zones.

KPI correlation (e.g., high call drop rate linked to weak RSSI or poor SINR).


Phase 3: Optimization Proposals

Parameter tuning: Handover thresholds, power control, cell reselection.

Hardware changes: Antenna tilting, additional sites, sectorization.

Frequency optimization: Refarming unused bands, interference reduction.


Phase 4: Validation

Simulate with tools (Atoll, Mentum Planet, or MATLAB models).

Field re-measurements after implementing changes.

KPI comparison before/after optimization.



---

4. Expected Deliverables

Detailed network performance report.

KPI improvement charts & coverage maps.

Optimization guidelines for the operator.

Simulation files & scripts.



---

5. Potential Tools & Technologies

Drive test tools: TEMS Investigation, Nemo Outdoor.

Planning tools: Atoll, Mentum Planet.

Data analysis: MATLAB, Python, Excel, QGIS.



---

6. Benefits for the Company

Enhanced customer satisfaction through better QoS.

Reduced churn (customers leaving for competitors).

More efficient use of spectrum and infrastructure.

Data-driven insights for future 5G deployment.
